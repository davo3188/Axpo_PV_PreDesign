## Fixed structures

Module TOPCon 132c M10 bifacial 2.382 × 1.134 m (30 mm). Sections «T 15° / AO 29° SUD» (current) and an «old
version» at AO 25°. Supports: vertical piles or concrete footing (shape and number of piles indicative only).

Unloading area (crane 44 t / 22 t, radii R6 / R12): a 12.00 m zone along the road (overall 12.00 × 8.00 m with the
road side, 1.00 m margins); around the station 3.00 m behind and on the side and 1.00 m to the road are not to be
covered by modules. Source IT-PC — overall dimensions **verify**.
